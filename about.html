<!--- Story --------------->
<body>
    <section class="statement">
    <h2>Psychology</h2>
    <h6>My degree in psychology is something that I apply every single day. It helps me understand someone’s motivations and goals and how I can collaborate with them (or market something to them, best learn from them, or resolve conflicts—it’s endless!).</h6>

    <p>“Stop psychoanalyzing me!” my best friend use to accuse me of. It was an inside joke between us since I had an intuition of what was going through her head and loved observing human behavior. My innate understanding of psychology drives my interest in people and has played a meaningful role in my choice to become a UX Designer.</p>

    <h2>Non-profit & AmeriCorps</h2>
    <h6>Nothing has prepared me more to approach my work with empathy, curiosity, and a problem-solving mindset than working in the non-profit sector.</h6>

    <p>Committing to mission-driven work requires you to approach your job with an understanding that, due to institutional systems and individual experiences, you will never be able to fully step in someone else's shoes. But that doesn’t mean you can’t wear a similar pair! It necessitates continuous learning: I’ve done everything from a complete rebrand, website rebuild, RFPs, designing marketing materials, photography, video editing, copywriting, to cleaning goose poop off rowing docks. </p>

    <h2>Marketing & Branding</h2>
    <h6>As a marketer, I want to know the business goals, the audience, the desired results, (and budget!) before putting any campaign together. The same mindset is needed within UX Design—innovation requires constraints and direction. </h6>
    <p>I love marketing and branding because its a creative place to tie together psychology and strategy. Behind every design decision I make, my experience in marketing bids me to ask: will this speak to our audience? Will it sell the product? Does the branding appeal to the user? How might this creative be improved?</p>

    <h2>Soul searching & my friend Matti</h2>
    <h6>So how did I actually arrive at UX Design? A ton of soul searching, meditation, research, and talking to everyone and their mother. </h6>
    <p>One fateful night at a Brooklyn house party, I met my friend Matti—a UX’er. As she described her day time job to me, I was overcome with the feeling you get when you know something is exactly right. Before I had finished my glass of wine, I knew my soul search was over. </p>

    <h2>Today</h2>
    <h6>I get to spend my days happily using my multi-disciplinary skills and interests to craft enjoyable and accessible designs. </h6>
    <p>Sound like we would work well together? I’d love to hear from you!</p>
