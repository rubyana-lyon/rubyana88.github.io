                    <p>Every aspect of Wine Notes was designed to relate wine back to the smell and flavors found in
                        nature, a produce aisle, or out in the garden. Flavor rules the hierarchy. Product pages boast
                        prominent flavor profile images along with called out highlights like pairings and sweetness.
                        Product filtering options are taste-centric, allowing users to quickly find and match wines
                        based on flavor preferences.</p>
                    <p>To further inform buying decisions Wine Notes implements a rating and review system which allows
                        customers the option to leave written reviews and rate how closely the product descriptions
                        actually align with the true wine flavor.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>The internet has an array of options for buying wine. I set out to understand if any of these companies were addressing what my research showed to be the most pressing problem––understanding what any given bottle of wine tastes like. <span class="orange-text">I ran a competitive analysis of three popular e-commerce sites: Fresh Direct, Verve Wine, and Winc.</span></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>Fresh Direct is a local NYC food and beverage delivery company. Right from the beginning, the website was not an inviting place to explore and learn about wine. There were no reviews or high-level information on flavor. Poor product photos soured the experience further. However, customers benefit from the one-stop shopping experience since they can buy groceries too. Convenience at its finest.</p>
                    <p>Verve Wine was founded by Master Sommelier Dustin Wilson. For all its information on wine, there wasn’t an easy to understand product flavor profile. This leaves the assumption that users already know what a riesling or merlot tastes like from Rhone. Once again there were no customer reviews. Verve Wine’s elegant design with intuitive navigation, tagging system, and recommendations was an inspiration for Wine Notes.</p>
                    <p>The final e-commerce site I explored was Winc, a wine club. Winc doesn’t offer written reviews and users have to commit to their wine club subscription. But if you’re into trying new wines, a wine club could be the way to go! Winc’s product page offered a fantastic flavor profile––by far it’s biggest strength.</p>
                    <p>These competitors inspired features for Wine Notes while also shining a light on untapped opportunities––opportunities I knew users wanted from my initial research.</p>

                    <h4 class="persona-age">Age 29, San Francisco</h4>
                    <p>Avery’s not on a website to only buy wine but to also learn. He enjoys getting to know a bottle by exploring its background: wineries, regions, and grapes. He’s looking to refine his palate and wants to try wine based on flavor profiles, balance, sweetness, etc.</p>

                    <p>Tara loves to try new wines and price is not an issue for her––quality and the right match are. She wants the assurance that the wine she’s purchasing will be a pleasure to drink not just for her, but for all her friends she’ll be serving it to.</p>

                <p>After 19 respondents, version one was winning by 58%. Even though that’s not statistically significant, people’s reasons for choosing it were strong. I moved forward with version one.</p>

                <p>My initial user surveys gave me insights into the highest ranked information shoppers want to see at a glance: product image, price, rating. With so many different ways to filter and sort wine, I explored different navigation patterns.</p>
                <p>The product page is where Wine Notes really shined and differentiated itself from its competitors. The flavor profile is broken down and explained through both text and image. Reviews are easy to read and give from the product page.</p>
                <p>It was time to put my ideas to the test. Using my low fidelity wireframes I conducted both in-person interviews and collected quantitative data using maze.design.</p>
