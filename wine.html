                <div class="col-lg-8">
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The internet has an array of options for buying wine. I set out to understand if any of these companies were addressing what my research showed to be the most pressing problem— understanding what any given bottle of wine tastes like. <span class="orange-text">I ran a competitive analysis of three popular e-commerce sites: Fresh Direct, Verve Wine, and Winc.</span></p>
                    <div class="competitor-paragraph">
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Fresh Direct is a local NYC food and beverage delivery company. Right from the beginning, the website was not an inviting place to explore and learn about wine. There were no reviews or high-level information on flavor. Poor product photos soured the experience further. However, customers benefit from the one-stop shopping experience since they can buy groceries too. Convenience at its finest.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Verve Wine was founded by Master Sommelier Dustin Wilson. For all its information on wine, there wasn’t an easy to understand product flavor profile. This leaves the assumption that users already know what a riesling or merlot tastes like from Rhone. Once again there were no customer reviews. Verve Wine’s elegant design with intuitive navigation, tagging system, and recommendations was an inspiration for Wine Notes..</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The final e-commerce site I explored was Winc, a wine club. Winc doesn’t offer written reviews and users have to commit to their wine club subscription. But if you’re into trying new wines, a wine club could be the way to go! Winc’s product page offered a fantastic flavor profile–– by far it’s biggest strength.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">These competitors inspired features for Wine Notes while also shining a light on untapped opportunities—pportunities I knew users wanted from my initial research. </p>

                    <p>My initial user surveys gave me insights into the highest ranked information shoppers want to see at a glance: product image, price, rating. With so many different ways to filter and sort wine, I explored different navigation patterns.</p>
                    <p>The product page is where Wine Notes really shined and differentiated itself from its competitors. The flavor profile is broken down and explained through both text and image. Reviews are easy to read and give from the product page.</p>
                    <p>It was time to put my ideas to the test. Using my low fidelity wireframes I conducted both in-person interviews and collected quantitative data using maze.design.</p>

                    <p>Friction also popped up as test takers moved through checkout. I thought I was being clever by including 3 screens in one for checkout. As people moved through inputting their information, next buttons were supposed to appear indicating it was time to move to the next section. This was lost on people. Users tried jumping ahead to shipping before completing billing. To ease the cognitive load I reduced the transparency on all inactive fields. I also added an inactive “next” button from the very start to help show when it was time to move on.</p>
