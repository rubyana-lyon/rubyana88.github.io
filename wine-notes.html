            <h3>What’s an appellation, anyways?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content-r">
            <p>Varietal, vintage, appellation, region—traditional wine e-commerce websites structure their information architecture and content by classifying buckets that mean little in terms of flavor to someone who is not well acquainted to wine. <span class="highlight">How do we redesign the wine shopping experience to make flavor understandable to an every day (or not so often!) consumer?</span>
            </p>
        </div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <div class="content-r">
        <p>Every aspect of Wine Notes was designed to relate wine back to the smell and flavors found in nature, a produce aisle, or out in the garden. Flavor rules the hierarchy. Product pages boast prominent flavor profile images along with called out highlights like pairings and sweetness. Product filtering options are taste-centric, allowing users to quickly find and match wines based on flavor preferences.</p>
        <p>
        To further inform buying decisions Wine Notes implements a rating and review system which allows customers the option to leave written reviews and rate how closely the product descriptions actually align with the true wine flavor.

        </p>
        <h6>I wanted to answer the following questions:</h6>

<!--- COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS --------------->
<div class="layout analysis-intro">
    <div>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="content-r">
        <p>
            The internet has an array of options for buying wine. I set out to understand if any of these companies were addressing what my research showed to be the most pressing problem––understanding what any given bottle of wine tastes like. <span class="highlight"> I ran a competitive analysis of three popular e-commerce sites: Fresh Direct, Verve Wine, and Winc.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fresh Direct is a local NYC food and beverage delivery company. Right from the beginning, the website was not an inviting place to explore and learn about wine. There were no reviews or high-level information on flavor. Poor product photos soured the experience further. However, customers benefit from the one-stop shopping experience since they can buy groceries too. Convenience at its finest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Verve Wine was founded by Master Sommelier Dustin Wilson. For all its information on wine, there wasn’t an easy to understand product flavor profile. This leaves the assumption that users already know what a riesling or merlot tastes like from Rhone. Once again there were no customer reviews. Verve Wine’s elegant design with intuitive navigation, tagging system, and recommendations was an inspiration for Wine Notes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final e-commerce site I explored was Winc, a wine club. Winc doesn’t offer written reviews and users have to commit to their wine club subscription. But if you’re into trying new wines, a wine club could be the way to go! Winc’s product page offered a fantastic flavor profile––by far it’s biggest strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            These competitors inspired features for Wine Notes while also shining a light on untapped opportunities––opportunities I knew users wanted from my initial research.

<div class="layout persona-intro">

        <h4>behind the wine: user Personas</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="content-r">
        <p>My three user types were developed based off respondants from my initial surveys.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="persona-grid">

    <h3>Newbie,</br>Maya</h3>
    <h3>Explorer,</br>Avery</h3>
    <h3>Experienced,</br>Tara</h3>
    <p class="persona-quote">“I must be missing out on wine that I may like simply because I don't see anything more than the wine term it's under.”</p>
    <p class="persona-quote">“It would be awesome to buy flights from different countries, new world vs old world, complexity vs balance, cherry vs earthy.”</p>
    <p class="persona-quote">“I've learned different characteristics of different regions. It is fun to put your knowledge to the test when tasting wine.”</p>
    <h4>Age 23, Portland</h4>
    <h4>Age 29, San Francisco</h4>
    <h4>Age 36, Boston</h4>
    <p>
        Why does Maya drink wine? “Essentially its juice with a kick. It's the best option for those who don't prefer hard liquor.” Maya simply wants to be assured she will like what she buys. She often chooses wine based off of price and the label artwork and never knows if she’s going to like it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Avery’s not on a website to only buy wine but to also learn. He enjoys getting to know a bottle by exploring its background: wineries, regions, and grapes. He’s looking to refine his palate and wants to try wine based on flavor profiles, balance, sweetness, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tara loves to try new wines and price is not an issue for her––quality and the right match are. She wants the assurance that the wine she’s purchasing will be a pleasure to drink not just for her, but for all her friends she’ll be serving it to.

    <div class="content-r">
        <p>
            My initial user surveys gave me insights into the highest ranked information shoppers want to see at a glance: product image, price, rating. With so many different ways to filter and sort wine, I explored different navigation patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The product page is where Wine Notes really shined and differentiated itself from its competitors. The flavor profile is broken down and explained through both text and image. Reviews are easy to read and give from the product page.

        </p>
        <p>
            It was time to put my ideas to the test. Using my low fidelity wireframes I conducted both in-person interviews and collected quantitative data using maze.design.

            Friction also popped up as test takers moved through checkout. I thought I was being clever by including 3 screens in one for checkout. As people moved through inputting their information, next buttons were supposed to appear indicating it was time to move to the next section. This was lost on people. Users tried jumping ahead to shipping before completing billing. To ease the cognitive load I reduced the transparency on all inactive fields. I also added an inactive “next” button from the very start to help show when it was time to move on.

            I assumed that keeping the ability to leave a review on the product page would be a “lighter” and easier experience than needing to creating an account. I was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found that 80% of test takers wanted to log into an account to leave a review. Even more cumbersome—some test-takers backtracked through every step they had previously taken to checkout in order to locate the wine they wanted to review. I needed to pivot from my original design.

        </p>
        <p>
            I went back and sketched out a new onboarding experience and account page. From here users could directly view previous orders and leave reviews. Lesson learned: people leave reviews from their account page, not a product page.
