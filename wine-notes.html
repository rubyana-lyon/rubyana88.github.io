                        <p class="section-paragraph">Fresh Direct is a local NYC food and beverage delivery company. Right from the beginning, the website was not an inviting place to explore and learn about wine. There were no reviews or high-level information on flavor. Poor product photos soured the experience further. However, customers benefit from the one-stop shopping experience since they can buy groceries too. Convenience at its finest.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Verve Wine was founded by Master Sommelier Dustin Wilson. For all its information on wine, there wasn’t an easy to understand product flavor profile. This leaves the assumption that users already know what a riesling or merlot tastes like from Rhone. Once again there were no customer reviews. Verve Wine’s elegant design with intuitive navigation, tagging system, and recommendations was an inspiration for Wine Notes..</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The final e-commerce site I explored was Winc, a wine club. Winc doesn’t offer written reviews and users have to commit to their wine club subscription. But if you’re into trying new wines, a wine club could be the way to go! Winc’s product page offered a fantastic flavor profile–– by far it’s biggest strength.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">These competitors inspired features for Wine Notes while also shining a light on untapped opportunities—pportunities I knew users wanted from my initial research. </p>

                    <p>The product page is where Wine Notes really shined and differentiated itself from its competitors. The flavor profile is broken down and explained through both text and image. Reviews are easy to read and give from the product page.</p>
                    <p>It was time to put my ideas to the test. Using my low fidelity wireframes I conducted both in-person interviews and collected quantitative data using maze.design.</p>

As people moved through inputting their information, next buttons were supposed to appear indicating it was time to move to the next section. This was lost on people. Users tried jumping ahead to shipping before completing billing. To ease the cognitive load I reduced the transparency on all inactive fields. I also added an inactive “next” button from the very start to help show when it was time to move on.</p>

                    <p>My original high fidelity mockups laid the groundwork for Wine Note’s branding. By visually exploring the product I become intimately familiar with the hues and color palette associated with it. The playfulness and color saturation of fruit would ultimately influence the brand identity.</p>

                    <p>The chosen name acts as a double entendre. First, and most obvious, it conveys what the product provides: notes and information on wine. Second, the flavor and scent we experience while drinking wine is also called a “note”. Wine notes are what the shop is committed to exploring with customers.</p>

A bright purple encouraged action and brought energy to the design.</p>

                    <p>An important component of any e-commerce site is the ability to sort and filter products. I wanted to better understand if users preferred text alone or text with icons to help them navigate the product menu. Using usabilityhub.com I conducted a preference test for two different designs. The question was simple: Which menu is easier to navigate? The one with fruit icons or the one without?</p>
                    <p>I received 18 responses for my test, 56% of which preferred the menu with icons. One test taker summarized its success by saying, “There is a lot of information to sift through and the icons make that section quicker to read.”</p>
                    <p>Although the test was not statistically significant I decided to move forward with a navigation system that incorporated icons and text.</p>

                    <p>The creation of Wine Notes has sparked my imagination for what could come next. Initial user research revealed that 78.6% of survey-takers would opt to take a wine preference test online. Additionally, 92.9% of respondents would read more about the region, grape, or winery.</p>
                    <p>A test to understand user’s flavor preferences would make the website even stronger––and some competitors are already doing this. As always, further research should be conducted to discover what else would help users feel more confident in the choices they make when buying wine.</p>
