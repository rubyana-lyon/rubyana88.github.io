                    <p>In the United States, sixty-eight percent of U.S. households, or about 85 million families, own a pet. Animals are now an integral part of our family structure, however, technology for pets hasn't caught up. Enter, Fetch.</p>
                    <p>This IOS app is on a mission to make managing pet data and care, simple. Owners can access medical records, share care instructions, set reminders, and track pet fitness. Never will a dog be lost again, a cat overweight or a rabies vaccination missed (OK, your cat may still be overweight, but you get the gist).</p>

                    <h5>Pain points & <br>solutions</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>I set out to understand the mentality of pet owners and their everyday pain points. To narrow down priority features I surveyed over 30 pet owners. <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-O0yKk85IaYOJTbiXRhgz5ndw3qCQAYKijZdcX4xdgss90Q/viewform" target="_blank">Check out the user survey</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQEGhKETw0ShTfvTN8_rkqEjYA0MxbaYambmhBb8uwk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">survey takeaways</a></p>
                    <p>Four main takeaways emerged from the results:</p>
                    <ol class="ordered-list">
                        <li><p>Trust in thy neighbor. Owners wanted to feel assured that caretakers were systematically following instructions and overseeing pets with attention to detail.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Records = hot mess. Vet records existed in paper files scattered around the house, online at the vet's office, or lost forever somewhere in between. Owners needed an organized system where looking up a record was as easy as a walk in the park.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Teamwork makes the dream work. Having a way to remind themselves and family members about appointments, expired vaccinations, and daily walks were key.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Fitness isn't a trend. A pet needs exercise and an owner needs data. By using a smart collar (pet wearable), stats and mapping allow users to stay on top of daily pet fitness levels.</p></li>

                    <p>There are numerous applications to help us care for pets and yet each one is pigeon-holed. There are applications for managing medical records (VitusVet), and others for managing pet sitters (Rover), and still more for smart collars (Whistle 3). However, no application had attempted what Fetch aimed to do: unify the most important aspects of pet management into one holistic system. I saw an opportunity.</p>

                        <p>Carmen relies on her teenagers to pitch in with their dog, the vet to alert her to appointments, and the neighbor to call when her dog is on the loose. Although she knows her kids love their pets, she doesn’t always trust them to remember their assigned chores. She needs a smart way to track where her dog goes, remind her family to feed and walk the pets, and the ability to stay on top of appointments and records.</p>

                        <p>Isabelle owns an aging dog that requires daily medication. She is readily available to administer his prescriptions but would like a way to check them off each day. When the family travels, their dog stays at a “pet hotel” and doesn’t eat. They’d like to start using an in-home sitter. Having a tool to share detailed pet instructions and the ability to check in on her dog would be tremendously helpful.</p>

                        <p>Lindsey is the quintessential pet parent. She cares deeply about health and wellbeing and this extends to her pets. She keeps notes related to their health but feels disorganized when she gets to the vet – unable to recall specific timelines and details. She wants a “universal pet profile” that she can share with vets and pet sitters alike, to keep her on top of all the important aspects of being a pet parent: vet records, pet care instructions, and health metrics.</p>

                    <p>Fetch lives at the intersection of friendly, inviting (the warm and fuzzies you get with your pet), and professional. Although the primary users are pet owners, the company also markets itself to business owners. The color palette reflects this juxtaposition–a serious blue with a playful and invigorating yellow and green. The green also served as a nod to where all animals come from, nature.</p>
                    <p>The font choice reflects the brand’s modern values. Ubuntu is used in the logotype and as headers. It is a humanist style typeface commonly known for being modern, clean, and technical.</p>
                    <p>After extensive mind mapping, the name “Fetch” was selected. Fetch was derived from the idea of caretaking. One of the most basic aspects of owning a pet is giving it amble exercise, attention, and play. Although the game of fetch is often associated with dogs, it is also a fun game for cats. From a technological standpoint, the name captures the essence of the app–fetching information. When the concepts of play, care, and data are tied together, the name “Fetch” accurately represents the brand positioning.</p>

                    <p>My goal was to design solutions for the four main pain points uncovered in the initial user surveys. I looked to the top apps on the market for inspiration––Apple’s health app, Rover’s pet profile, Fitbit’s analytics, and the seamlessness of Instagram’s multiple account menus.</p>
                    <p>A significant amount of information goes into explaining a pet's story (personality, needs, likes/dislikes). The first challenge was designing an onboarding process that collected a large volume of information while also feeling engaging and fast. </p>
                    <p>From the pet profile, users can view and edit care instructions, set up their smart collar, and share profile information with contacts.</p>
                    <p>Within the health hub, big buttons allow pet owners to quickly filter by record type. A tagging system and search bar were also integrated to improve speed in locating a specific record. Records can be directly requested from veterinarians or manually added by a user.</p>
                    <p>The fitness page aims for simplicity through color and image. Owners see active minutes and can easily toggle back in time for a full history of pet activity.</p>
                    <p>Users receive notifications for upcoming appointments and various other reminders from the calendar section. Reminders can easily be scheduled and shared both internally on the app and with external calendars. Recurring events were added as a feature based on user feedback.</p>

                    <p>To discover design pain points, I utilized both in-person interviews and remote testing. Remote tests provided analytics and heatmaps to help us better understand user behavior, while in-person interviews filled us in with qualitative feedback. Participants completed the following 3 task scenarios.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add a pet profile</li>
                        <li>Add a medical record</li>
                        <li>Schedule a reminder</li>

                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>The pet onboarding process had the highest success rate of the 3 tasks (90%). That didn’t mean it was without flaws. I thought I had reduced the steps for creating a pet profile to the bare minimum, but users disagreed. They wanted fewer steps and less copy.</p>
                    <p>To cut down on the 8 onboarding screens I combined similar information together. Instead of one screen to select a pet type and another to select a gender, I grouped both questions together. This reduced clicks, lessened user fatigue, and shortened the progress bar. Ultimately onboarding went from 8 steps to 6. The pre-onboarding screen was reduced from 26 words to just 7. Further testing found that users were satisfied with the improved flow and had a close to 100% success rate.</p>

                    <p>Maze results showed a 40% give up/bounce rate for adding a medical record. This was due in part to the way the prototype’s hot spots were set up but also uploading options. Users had three options: “request records,” “take a photo,” or “manually add”. What’s the difference between “take a photo” and “manually add”? Good question! </p>
                    <p>I realized there was no reason to break these into 2 options. Users only required two paths: request a record or add one themselves. I combined the two options and then updated the copy so instructions were crystal clear: “request record from veterinarian” or “manually enter record”.</p>

                    <p>This task scenario is where things really broke down.</p>
                    <p>The first hurdle for users was the concept of notifications vs reminders. I was asking them to schedule a reminder, something that feels time-bound while labeling the section as “notifications”. Although I equated notifications to reminders, users did not. One tester said, “It’s a little confusing because it seems that the list [of notifications] is actually a list of reminders that need to be completed in the future but haven’t been completed yet. And to me, notifications are ‘real time’ things that need to be done now or should have been done already.”</p>
                    <p>I renamed this section to “reminders” and then got to work on the list of additional features that were suggested during testing. I added in the ability to make recurring reminders, clarified who would be receiving the reminder, along with adding a location and the ability to sync with Google Calendar.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I cleaned up styling across the app to build repetition and thus ease of use. This allowed users to learn that the “save” function will always be in the top right corner (which wasn’t clear to users before) and that all submissions are made through a button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

                    <p>The pet profile is one of the most central elements in Fetch. It houses a large amount of information about a pet while simultaneously aiming to quickly deliver high-level information. The original design solution relied on a scrolling screen with optional chevrons to go deeper and colored icons to quickly call attention to information. I created two alternative solutions which chunked information into 3 categories. I hypothesized that users would feel less overwhelmed with information broken up. I was also curious if the pet profile picture size and shape would effect preference as well. I was certain that version 2 would be preferred given that it seemed quicker to navigate to specific information (here’s version 3). I was wrong. 86% of respondents preferred the scrolling screen.</p>
                    <p>“The colored icons in the extended profile gives me a lot of info very easily.”</p>
                    <p>Half of the respondents who preferred the first design mentioned that they chose it because of the colored icon list. The icons had the ability to quickly call attention to key information about a pet, reducing the cognitive load of finding information. Additionally, users did prefer seeing all the information laid out on one screen without needing to click on additional filters to learn more. A bigger pet profile picture was also preferred.</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong> make it visual with icons, call attention to information with color, show off the pups (a bigger pet profile picture is better) </p>

                    <p>A centralized hub for digital medical records is another important component within Fetch. I wanted to ensure that users could quickly any medical record they may be searching for. The app allows for tagging, categories, and filters. But I wanted to take it a step further by using color or icons to help users scan for information more quickly. My preference test aimed to determine if color or icons more quickly help a user identify a record type. Icons won. </p>
                    <p>“The icons tell me more about what the record is about–with the color-coding, I have to page back to reference what the colors mean. The icons are more self-explanatory!”</p>
                    <p>Takeaways: by making it visual through the use of icons, users can more quickly determine a record type.</p>

I aimed to keep the design intuitive and clean while delivering the many components necessary in creating a holistic approach to pet care.</p>

                    <p>Fetch aims to be the leading pet management system, and I believe to be a leader means to be a collaborator. I plan on future build-outs integrating with other leading software (Fitbit, Google Suite, and leading veterinarian tech platforms). The next phase has two goals:</p>
                    <ol class="ordered-list">
                        <li><p>Build out a working prototype for small business owners who use Fetch to work with pet owners.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Make acquiring medical records even more seamless by applying TrippIt-like technology so records can immediately be added from email to the health hub.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It was an absolute pleasure designing Fetch from the ground up and ensuring the design process shaped each decision I made in developing the product. Here’s to simplifying pet management, so we can get back to the important stuff, spending time with our furry friends.</p>
